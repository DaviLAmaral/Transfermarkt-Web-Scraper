# Transfermarkt Python Scraping
A simple Trasfermarkt League scraping project using some basic python libraries.
It scrapes player data from all clubs from the selected league.

First of all, run "Setup.py" to install all needed libraries

Non Graphic Version:
1. Run "TransfermarktS.py"
2. Insert any Transfermarkt league URL
3. Insert a Path to save a .xlsx excel sheet with the data
4. Wait the code to finish running.

Graphic Version:
1. Run "Transfermarkt Graphic.py"
2. Choose one league between all the available
3. Choose the path and name to save a .xlsx excel file
4. Generate the league
Additional options:
You can add regional leagues or lower divisions by uncommenting lines 15,16,18,19,21,22 (the program will be slower).
You can scrape the top 5 leagues in at the same time by pressing the last button, you only have to select the path and name of the file before (it is 5 times slower than normal, of course).

OBs: Maximizing or re-scailing the window can turn it difficult to understand
